                        Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing
                        between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges
                        of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy
                        text in each section and the edges of the section.

                        Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your
                        choosing). Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your
                        choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the
                        section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change
                        the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section and
                        section title region that is 1px thick.est of your assignment, possibly resulting in a
                        much lower grade.
